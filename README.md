#ng-redux-http-middleware

#### This is currently WIP.

This package contains a middleware for API requests in Angular using $http. This is a port of the middleware from the [Redux Real World Example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world)

Inspired by [Redux React Router](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-react-router) by [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite)
